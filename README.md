# Hangman
Guessing the next best letter

This project uses probability to guess the next letter of hangman given the already guessed letters.
To run this, just download word_counts_file.txt and the jupyter notebook and run the cells in the jupyter notebook.
There is no GUI for this game, but it would be easy to make one with the functions provided.
